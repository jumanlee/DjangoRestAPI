# Introduction

This project is to implement REST API endpoints for bioscience researchers who are working on protein domains. The API allows the researchers to regularly query for the data they've generated. The API endpoints specification and data are explained further in below sections. All the bioscience data is stored in the three csv files, which the python script that I have written will transfer all into the default sqlite database. This will happen after you run the migration and then the python script, explained in the next section. Note that this project is my completed mid-term project for my web development module at the University of London. 

# Instructions

First, to launch the web service on your machine, you will need to do the following: 

At the root of the directory: <br />
1) (For MacOS) Create a virtual environment by running: python3 -m venv <your environment name> <br />
2) (For MacOS) Switch to the virtual environment by running: source <your environment name>/bin/activate <br />
3) To install all the dependencies, run: pip install -r requirements.txt  <br />
4) Run migration: python manage.py migrate <br />
5) Run the python script to transfer csv file data to sqlite, this will take a few minutes due to large data volume: python scripts/populate_data.py  <br />
6) Then you can start the server: python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8080 <br />

# Data explanation

Organisms are classified using a system of Taxonomy. Each organism is assigned a Genus and Species name and the NCBI Taxonomy Database assigns a single integer number as an ID value for each species. In summary, the relationships between the different sets of data are described as: <br />

Organisms HAVE MANY Proteins <br />
Organisms HAVE A Genus name <br />
Organisms HAVE A Species name <br />
Proteins HAVE MANY domains <br />
Proteins HAVE ONE sequence <br />
Domains HAVE ONE pfam domain ID <br />

The relationships form the basis of how the tables are designed e.g. what the primary_key and foreign_key relationships are and what goes into what tables. <br />

proteinsequence.csv contains protein animo acid sequences. Each record consists of two columns. The first column is the Protein ID and the second column is the protein sequence in single letter code. The longest sequence is just less than 40,000 characters long. Not all proteins in the data set have sequences: <br />

protein ID <br />
Protein Sequence <br />

proteinorganism.csv contains domain annotations. Each row is the data for a Protein Domain assigned to a different Protein. There are 10,000 records in this file. The columns are: <br />

Protein ID, <br />
Organism TAXA ID, <br />
Organism Clade Idenitifer <br />
Organism Scientific name ("Genus Species") <br />
Domain description <br />
Domain ID <br />
Domain Start Coordinate <br />
Domain End Coordinate <br />
Length of Protein <br />


pfam.csv has two columns: <br />

Domain/Pfam IDs <br />
Domain/Pfam Family description <br />
